The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
python Beautiful is better than ugly.
python Explicit is better than implicit.
python Simple is better than complex.
python Complex is better than complicated.
python Flat is better than nested.
python Sparse is better than dense.
python Readability counts.
python Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
python Although practicality beats purity.
python Errors should never pass silently.
python Unless explicitly silenced.
python In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
python There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
python Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
python Now is better than never.
python Although never is often better than *right* now.
python If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
python If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
python Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
